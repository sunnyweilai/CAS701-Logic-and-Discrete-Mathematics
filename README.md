# CAS701-Logic-and-Discrete-Mathematics


This is a graduate course I took in fall 2017 in McMaster University.
The course will cover some of the material encountered at the undergradu-ate courses on logic and discrete mathematics as well as advanced materialon  topics  such  as  proof  systems,  sets,  relations,  and  functions,  recursion,type theory, and  rst and higher order logic systems.  
There will be empha-sis on topics related to computer science and software engineering.
"MissionThe mission of this course is to give students a graduate-level understandingof 
the logic and discrete mathematics that is needed for computer scienceand software engineering.  

By the end of the course the student should:
1.  Understand what the mathematics process is and how it is employedin computing and engineering.
2.  Understand the main kinds of values and structures that are used tobuild mathematical models.
3.  Understand the logical principles underlying the mathematics processand embodied in  rst-order logic and simple type theory.
4.  Be  able  to  read  and  write  both  informal  and  formal  mathematicalproofs.
5.  Be able to express mathematical ideas in propositional logic,  rst-orderlogic, and simple type theory.
6.  Be familiar with the main kinds of mathematical software systems thatare available today.Students  taking  this  course  are  expected  to  have  some  familiarity  withpropositional  and   rst-order  logic  as  well  as  basic  undergraduate  mathe-matics.
